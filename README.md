Data Validation Automation for Migration Projects
Project Overview
This project aims to reduce the cost and effort involved in data validation during system migration activities by building a Power BI-based automation solution.
By introducing intermediate key tables and utilizing live connections, the project drastically reduces testing time per migration ticket and simplifies the validation process.

Problem Statement
During data migration projects, validating the migrated data is a time-consuming and manual process.
The current approach involved:
Manually comparing legacy and target systems.

High dependency on manual testing.
One iteration per ticket taking approximately 16 hours.
An estimated annual cost of $240,000 for 600 migration tickets.

Solution
We built a data validation automation model in Power BI using:
Intermediate key tables (DIM_1, DIM_2, DIM_3).
One-to-many relationships for efficient data analysis.
Live connections to source and target systems for real-time validation.
This new model reduced validation time per ticket to 2 hours ‚Äî leading to:
Faster migration validation cycles.
Cost savings of approximately $210,000 annually.
Higher accuracy and ease of identifying mismatches.

Features
üìä Power BI Data Model: Optimized with intermediate dimension tables.
üîó Live Connection: Real-time validation between legacy and target systems.
‚ö° Reduced Validation Time: From 16 hours to just 2 hours per migration ticket.
üí≤ Significant Cost Savings: ~87.5% reduction in validation costs.
üîç Improved Accuracy: Easy identification of mismatches and validation errors.
üöÄ Scalable Design: Can be adapted for multiple migration projects.

Technologies Used
Microsoft Power BI (Desktop and Service)
Power Query
SQL Server (optional for data sources)
SharePoint Online for collaboration
